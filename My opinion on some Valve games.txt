HL1: Perfection.
HL1 Alpha: My eyes hurt.
HL1 Day One: The lighting do be great tho.
HL1 Blue Shift: Gearbox really does have some great stuff, especially when they don't add extra enemies.
HL1 Opposing Force: WON version's first map's broken, Race X looks like bootleg Xenians, the heck? I do like the Displacer Cannon, though. It literally borrows a bunch of parts from Doom's BFG, and I'm a big Doom fan.
HL2: To be honest, the headcrabs and zombies look really crappy, but the rest of the game's pretty good.
HL2 Beta: Overrated, edgy, and there's very few pieces of actual content from the beta, unless you count the 2000 unneccesary props. To be honest though, some parts do actually look good, such as the early headcrab (the one that snuck into release HL2's preview screenshots on Steam, and into the headcrab model used in Eli's lab in that one kitchen with vorts in it.
HL2 Episodes: Great stuff, especially with those vorts and gman sections and all that. Valve should've remade the zombies and headcrabs, though, instead of just adding more animations to them, and adding the zombine.
HL1 Source: Honestly, it adds even more comedy than the original HL1 already had. Plus, most of the bugs are map-specific, so if you want a less buggy playthrough, just get the Half-Life Resized Maps mod. HLRM turns HL:S into what Valve intended it to be.
HLA: I don't have it, but I've seen people play it and crap, so whatever. It's perfect. The headcrabs look like a mix of HL1's and HL2's headcrabs, everything's high poly, it has an amazing physics engine, it's got it all. 
Portal 1: Really crappy, feels like just an unfinished HL2 mod.
Portal 2: Amazing stuff, feels like Half-Life Alyx.
